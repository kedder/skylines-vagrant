# This is potentially destructive to the nodes mysql password attributes, since
# we iterate over all the app databags. If this database server provides
# databases for multiple applications, the last app found in the databags
# will win out, so make sure the databags have the same passwords set for
# the root, repl, and debian-sys-maint users.
